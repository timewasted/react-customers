react-customers
===============

A simple customer management system.  I wanted to learn [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), so I wrote this to help facilitate that desire.  React code lives in the `app/Resources/public/jsx` folder.  The backend is [Symfony 2](http://symfony.com/), which was chosen primary to get things up and running quickly.
